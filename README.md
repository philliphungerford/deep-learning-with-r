# Companion R notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with R"

This repository contains R notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications).

For readability, these notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles, and omit everything else in the book: text paragraphs, figures, and pseudocode. 
**If you want to be able to follow what's going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side by side with your copy of the book.**

These notebooks use TensorFlow 2.6.
