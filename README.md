# Companion R notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with R"

This repository contains R notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff).
For readability, these notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles, and omit everything else in the book: text paragraphs, figures, and pseudocode. 
**If you want to be able to follow what's going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side by side with your copy of the book.**

These notebooks use TensorFlow 2.6.
